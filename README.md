### Build a diary from your favourite messaging apps

**SumahoNikki** ("Smart phone diary" in Japanese) in a small TUI app that allows you to build diaries and organize your notes from Whatsapp and Telegram chats.  
I've built this project since I love the [Bullet Journal](https://bulletjournal.com/) note-taking methodology, but always struggled with "tidying up" my notes.  
The objective of this project is to allow everyone to take "bullets" on their preferred messaging app and have their messages automatically formatted in a nice diary/notes.  
A nice extra is being able to easily have media in your diary, since you are building it with your phone :)

The project has been built with customizability in mind; end-users can, to some extent, pick the shape of their bullets and developers can use the [SumahoNikki API]() to build plugins for all kinds of notes!
